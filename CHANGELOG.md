## [1.3.2] - 2024-05-24
### Added
- **New Themes**: Added 'Sunrise' (Orange/Warm) and 'Lime' (Green) themes.
- **Adaptive Icon**: Added setting to make the Kirby icon adapt colors based on the selected theme.

## [1.3.1] - 2024-05-23
### Added
- Added `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Implemented handling for empty AI responses: if the model returns no text (e.g., due to safety filters), the chat bubble now displays the specific `finishReason` (e.g., `SAFETY`, `RECITATION`) to the user.
- Added custom `Toast` (Notification) and `CustomDialog` (Alert/Confirm/Input) components to provide a consistent, non-intrusive UI experience.
- Added footer with version number and AI disclaimer.
- Added "About & Open Source" section in Settings.
- Added visual watermark to README.

### Changed
- Replaced native browser `alert`, `confirm`, and `prompt` dialogs with custom UI components across the application (`App`, `Header`, `SettingsModal`, `ApiKeyManagement`).
- Refactored `SettingsModal` into modular components (`GeneralAppearanceSettings`, `ApiKeyManagement`, etc.) for better maintainability.
- Refactored `ChatInterface` to use a dedicated `ChatMessage` component.
- Removed "Rainbow" theme.
- Removed visual drag handles from sorting lists to maintain a cleaner UI while keeping functionality.
